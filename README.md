# CS 237 Bank Project
## Yash Singh, Evan Zhong, Young Lin, Kevin Li
### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to generate a simulated bank. The bank should be able to open and close accounts for users (with savings and checking accounts), allow users to deposit and withdraw money, allow users to borrow money from the bank. 
## Iteration 2
### Accomplished in this iteration:
In this iteration, we revised our code to remove file dependability. We implemented features allowing a user to open an account, allowing them to view their balance, allowing them to deposit money, allowing them to withdraw money, and allowing them to transfer funds. 
### Goals for Next Iteration
Next iteration, we intend to add the ability for a user to borrow money from the bank and add file functionality so that after quitting the program, the file retains account information which will be added to the bank after restarting the program. 
### Functionality
The code written in this iteration is functional
### Script
There is a script present that allows a user to run our program from the terminal. 
 
        bash script.sh
