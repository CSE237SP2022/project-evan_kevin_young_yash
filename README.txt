The goal of this project is to generate a simulated bank. The bank should be able to open and close accounts for users (with savings and checking accounts), allow users to deposit and withdraw money, allow users to borrow money from the bank. 

ITERATION 1: 

In this iteration, functionality was built to allow users to open accounts, and borrow money from the bank. We have begun working on functionality to allow users to deposit money. 

Next iteration, we will finish the deposit functionality and write code to allow users to withdraw money and transfer funds between accounts. 

We are working on the user being able to deposit money, so it currently doesn't work, but is close. 

To run code from the command line: 

javac -d bin src/menu/*.java
java -cp bin account.Account
