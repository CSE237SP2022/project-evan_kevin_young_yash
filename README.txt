The goal of this project is to generate a simulated bank. The bank should be able to open and close accounts for users (with savings and checking accounts), allow users to deposit and withdraw money, allow users to borrow money from the bank. 

ITERATION 2: 

In this iteration, we revised our code to remove file dependability. We implemented features allowing a user to open an account, allowing them to view their balance, allowing them to deposit money, allowing them to withdraw money, and allowing them to transfer funds. 

Next iteration, we intend to add the ability for a user to borrow money from the bank and add file functionality so that after quitting the program, the file retains account information which will be added to the bank after restarting the program. 

Everything implemented in this iteration is functional. 

There is a script present that allows a user to run our program from the terminal.
