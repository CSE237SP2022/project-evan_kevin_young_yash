The goal of this project is to generate a simulated bank. The bank should be able to open and close accounts for users (with savings and checking accounts), allow users to deposit and withdraw money, allow users to borrow money from the bank. 

ITERATION 1: 

In this iteration, functionality was built to allow users to open and close accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and borrow money from the bank. 

Next iteration, we will refine our text output as a storage method and add functionality for users accruing interest on their account holdings. 

Anything you implemented that doesn't currently work? 

To run code from the command line: 

javac -d bin src/menu/*.java
java -cp bin packageName(s).nameOfClass (change this)
